ABOUT

Spork is a silly little piece of code that exists for no good reason at all.
It's fork() and exec() rolled into one function call. Whee.

INSTALLATION

If you want to use the man page, copy it to section three of your manual
library (usually somewhere like /usr/share/man/man3 or somesuch). Put the
header file somewhere #include will find it. Lastly, link the implementation
file into your program. Whee.
